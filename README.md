## E-commerce_Analysis_in_Python

This analysis consists of three parts, AOV analysis, Payment method analysis and Retention analysis.

**Average Order Value(AOV)** is a central ecommerce metric, it tracks the average dollar amount spent each time a customer places an order on a website or mobile app.
Knowing your companyâ€™s average order value helps you evaluate your overall online marketing efforts and pricing strategy by giving you the metrics needed to measure the long-term value of individual customers.
In the AOV analysis, I analyzed AOVs for different customer segments to understand the purchase behaviors of different customer segments and provided insights about how to increase AOV for e-commerce business.

**Payment Methods** are critical to optimize user experience when they shop online and increase revenue. In the Payment Method Analysis, I analyzed customer preference for different payment methods and tried to figure out which payment method brings most of the revenue.

**Retention Analysis** aims to answer the following question: What percentage of new users will remain as customers? Retention rate is a critical metric for every business because at the end of the day, we want users to stay and contribute to the growth of revenue.
In the Retention Analysis, I analyzed Monthly Retention Rate and Weekly Retention Rate Trend to understand how well users are kept and provided insights about how to improve rentention rate.
